cd-command is a primitive command-line CD player/ripper. It can do CDDB lookups to get the names of tracks, and has a caching system so that it can remember lookups even when offline. It can rip to .wav file or use an external encoder program.

Full details of usage can be found by ./cd-command -?

Compilation should just be the usual:

./configure; make
